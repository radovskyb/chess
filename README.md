# Description
This chess game is being written solely based on the fact that I have never written a chess game in any of the programming languages I have ever learned over the years and thought it might be a fun challenge to write, without any prior knowledge of how other people usually write chess games.

Because of this, I know it may end up lacking lots of the optimized code and algorithms that programmed chess games use, but I find that this also makes it more fun to write.
